Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. This molecule was developed by Schering AG and approved for use in the United States in 1970.

It is used mainly as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts, but it is also an ingredient in adhesives, paint removers, typewriter correction fluids, and spot removers. Trichloroethylene is not thought to occur naturally in the environment. However, it has been found in underground water sources and many surface waters as a result of the manufacture, use, and disposal of the chemical. This molecule appears as a clear colorless volatile liquid having a chloroform-like odor. Denser than water and is slightly soluble in water. Noncombustible. Used as a solvent, fumigant, in the manufacture of other chemicals, and for many other uses. This molecule is a member of the class of chloroethenes that is ethene substituted by chloro groups at positions 1, 1 and 2. It has a role as an inhalation anaesthetic and a mouse metabolite. This molecule is a halocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent, not to be confused with the similar 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also known as chlorothene. It has been sold under a variety of trade names including Trimar and Trilene and used as a volatile anesthetic and as an inhaled obstetrical analgesic. Environmental exposure, particularly groundwater and drinking water contamination from industrial discharge, is a major concern for human health and has been the subject of numerous incidents and lawsuits. This molecule is released into the atmosphere from industrial degreasing operations. Acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to trichloroethylene can affect the human central nervous system (CNS), with symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, confusion, euphoria, facial numbness, and weakness. Liver, kidney, immunological, endocrine, and developmental effects have also been reported in humans. A recent analysis of available epidemiological studies reports trichloroethylene exposure to be associated with several types of cancers in humans, especially kidney, liver, cervix, and lymphatic system. Animal studies have reported increases in lung, liver, kidney, and testicular tumors and lymphoma. The Agency is currently reassessing the cancer classification of trichloroethylene. This molecule is a synthetic, light sensitive, volatile, colorless, liquid that is miscible with many non-polar organic solvents. This molecule is used mainly as a degreaser for metal parts. Upon combustion, it produces irritants and toxic gases. Occupational exposure to trichloroethylene is associated with excess incidences of liver cancer, kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05) This molecule is a natural product found in Bos taurus and Caenorhabditis elegans with data available. This molecule is a solvent and extractive in the manufacture of foods. One recent review of the epidemiology of kidney cancer rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene. In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, [t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen. The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the NAS suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population. The chemical compound trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available federal and state surveys, between 9% to 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the U.S. may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies are in compliance with the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 5 ppb. In addition, a growing concern in recent years at sites with TCE contamination in soil or groundwater has been vapor intrusion in buildings, which has resulted in indoor air exposures, such is in a recent case in the McCook Field Neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio. This molecule has been detected in 852 Superfund sites across the United States, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and as amended annual water quality testing is required for all public drinking water distributors. The EPA'S current guidelines for TCE can be found here. It should be noted that the EPA's table of TCE Releases to Ground is dated 1987 to 1993, thereby omitting one of the largest Superfund Cleanup sites in the nation, the NIBW in Scottsdale, Arizona. The TCE released here occurred prior to its appearance in the municipal drinking wells in 1982. This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by distillation.This molecule: Parkinsonism and complex 1 mitochondrial neurotoxicity).

It is the 36th highest volume chemical produced in the United States. It is a colorless gas with a mild gasoline-like odor. About 75% of the manufactured 1,3-butadiene is used to make synthetic rubber. Synthetic rubber is widely used for tires on cars and trucks. This molecule is also used to make plastics including acrylics. Small amounts are found in gasoline. This molecule is a colorless gas with an aromatic odor. It is shipped as a liquefied gas under its vapor pressure. Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite. It is easily ignited. Its vapors are heavier than air and a flame can flash back to the source of leak very easily. It can asphyxiate by the displacement of air. It must be shipped inhibited as butadiene is liable to polymerization. If polymerization occurs in the container, it may violently rupture. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. It is used to make synthetic rubber and plastics, and to make other chemicals. This molecule is a butadiene with unsaturation at positions 1 and 3. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent and a mutagen. This molecule is a constant source of 1,3-butadiene. Although 1,3-butadiene breaks down quickly in the atmosphere, it is usually found in ambient air at low levels in urban and suburban areas. Acute (short-term) exposure to 1,3-butadiene by inhalation in humans results in irritation of the eyes, nasal passages, throat, and lungs. Epidemiological studies have reported a possible association between 1,3- butadiene exposure and cardiovascular diseases. Epidemiological studies of workers in rubber plants have shown an association between 1,3-butadiene exposure and increased incidence of leukemia. Animal studies have reported tumors at various sites from 1,3-butadiene exposure. EPA has classified 1,3- butadiene as carcinogenic to humans by inhalation. This molecule is a synthetic, colorless gas that is practically insoluble in water and soluble in ethanol, ether, acetone and benzene. It is used primarily as a monomer to manufacture many different types of polymers and copolymers and as a chemical intermediate in the production of industrial chemicals. When heated, 1,3-butadiene emits acrid fumes and is flammable. In the presence of air, it oxidizes to form explosive peroxides. The primary route of potential human exposure to this compound is inhalation. Acute exposure to 1,3-butadiene can cause irritation of the eyes, nasal passages and throat. At very high concentrations, inhalation of this gas can result in headache, fatigue, decreased blood pressure and pulse rate, central nervous system damage and unconsciousness. It is known to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05) This molecule is a natural product found in Oryza sativa with data available. This molecule is a simple conjugated diene with the formula C4H6. It is an important industrial chemical used as a monomer in the production of synthetic rubber. When the word butadiene is used, most of the time it refers to 1,3-butadiene. This molecule is inconvenient for laboratory use because it is a flammable gas subject to polymerization on storage. 3-Butadiene cyclic sulfone (sulfolene) is a convenient solid storable source for 1,3-butadiene for many laboratory purposes when the generation of sulfur dioxide byproduct in the reaction mixture is not objectionable. Long-term exposure has been associated with cardiovascular disease, there is a consistent association with leukemia, and weaker association with other cancers. Most butadiene is polymerized to produce synthetic rubber. While polybutadiene itself is a very soft, almost liquid material, copolymers prepared from mixtures of butadiene with styrene and/or acrylonitrile, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylonitrile butadiene (NBR) and styrene-butadiene (SBR) are tough and elastic. SBR is the material most commonly used for the production of automobile tires. Smaller amounts of butadiene are used to make the nylon intermediate, adiponitrile, by the addition of a molecule of hydrogen cyanide to each of the double bonds in a process called hydrocyanation developed by DuPont. Other synthetic rubber materials such as chloroprene, and the solvent sulfolane are also manufactured from butadiene. Butadiene is used in the industrial production of 4-vinylcyclohexene via a Diels Alder dimerization reaction and the vinylcyclohexene is a common impurity found in butadiene upon storage. Cyclooctadiene and cyclododecatriene are produced via nickel- or titanium-catalyzed dimerization and trimerization reactions, respectively. Butadiene is also useful in the synthesis of cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, as it reacts with double and triple carbon-carbon bonds through the Diels-Alder reaction. The name butadiene can also refer to the isomer, 1,2-butadiene, which is a cumulated diene. However, this allene is difficult to prepare and has no industrial significance. This diene is also not expected to act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction due to its structure. To effect a Diels-Alder reaction only a conjugated diene will suffice.",CHEMBL537970

Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.
This molecule is an alkyl aldehyde found in human biofluids. Human milk samples collected from women contains hexanal. Among mediators of oxidative stress, highly reactive secondary aldehydic lipid peroxidation products can initiate the processes of spontaneous mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and can also act as a growth-regulating factors and signaling molecules. In specimens obtained from adult patients with brain astrocytomas, lower levels of n-hexanal are associated with poorer patient prognosis. This molecule is a volatile compound that has been associated with the development of undesirable flavours. The content of hexanal, which is a major breakdown product of linoleic acid (LA, n - 6 PUFA) oxidation, has been used to follow the course of lipid oxidation and off-flavour development in foods, and have been proposed as one potential marker of milk quality. A cardboard-like off-flavour is frequently associated with dehydrated milk products. This effect is highly correlated with the headspace concentration of hexanal. (A7871, A7872).",CHEMBL280331

It may be formed from the breakdown of certain pollutants in outdoor air or from the burning of organic matter including tobacco, or fuels such as gasoline or oil. It is toxic to humans following inhalation, oral or dermal exposures. Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure may result in upper respiratory tract irritation and congestion. No information is available on its reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects in humans, and the existing animal cancer data are considered inadequate to make a determination that acrolein is carcinogenic to humans. This molecule is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This molecule is a natural product found in Zanthoxylum schinifolium, Nicotiana tabacum, and Phaseolus vulgaris with data available. This molecule is the simplest unsaturated aldehyde. It is a colourless liquid with a piercing, disagreeable, acrid smell. The smell of burnt fat (as when cooking oil is heated to its smoke point) is caused by glycerol in the burning fat breaking down into acrolein. It is produced industrially from propylene and mainly used as a biocide and a building block to other chemical compounds, such as the amino acid methionine. Acrolein is used as an etherification agent in the preparation of modified food starches. Acrolein is an herbicide and algicide used in water treatment. It is produced by microorganisms, e.g. Clostridium perfringens. Acrolein is a relatively electrophilic compound and a reactive one, hence its high toxicity. It is a good Michael acceptor, hence its useful reaction with thiols. It forms acetals readily, a prominent one being the spirocycle derived from pentaerythritol, diallylidene pentaerythritol. Acrolein participates in many Diels-Alder reactions, even with itself. Via Diels-Alder reactions, it is a precursor to some commercial fragrances, including lyral, norbornene-2-carboxaldehyde, and myrac aldehyde. Acrolein is toxic and is a strong irritant for the skin, eyes, and nasal passages. The main metabolic pathway for acrolein is the alkylation of glutathione. The WHO suggests a 'tolerable oral acrolein intake' of 7.5 mg/day per kilogram of body weight. Although acrolein occurs in French fries, the levels are only a few micrograms per kilogram.",CHEMBL721

Its use is controversial due to widespread contamination in drinking water and its associations with birth defects and menstrual problems when consumed by humans at concentrations below government standards. Although it has been banned in the European Union, it is still one of the most widely used herbicides in the world . This molecule is a suspected teratogen, causing demasculinization in male northern leopard frog even at low concentrations, and an estrogen disruptor. A 2010 study found that atrazine rendered 75 percent of male frogs sterile and turned one in 10 into females. A 2002 study found that exposure to atrazine caused male tadpoles to turn into hermaphrodites - frogs with both male and female sexual characteristics. But another study, requested by EPA and funded by Syngenta, was unable to reproduce these results. This molecule was banned in the European Union (EU) in 2004 because of its persistent groundwater contamination. In the United States, however, atrazine is one of the most widely used herbicides, with 76 million pounds of it applied each year, in spite of the restriction that used to be imposed. Its endocrine disruptor effects, possible carcinogenic effect, and epidemiological connection to low sperm levels in men has led several researchers to call for banning it in the US.Rates of biodegradation are affected by atrazine's low solubility, thus surfactants may increase the degradation rate. Though the two alkyl moieties readily support growth of certain microorganisms, the atrazine ring is a poor energy source due to the oxidized state of ring carbon. In fact, the most common pathway for atrazine degradation involves the intermediate, cyanuric acid, in which carbon is fully oxidized, thus the ring is primarily a nitrogen source for aerobic microorganisms. This molecule may be catabolized as a carbon and nitrogen source in reducing environments, and some aerobic atrazine degraders have been shown to use the compound for growth under anoxia in the presence of nitrate as an electron acceptor, a process referred to as a denitrification. When atrazine is used as a nitrogen source for bacterial growth, degradation may be regulated by the presence of alternative sources of nitrogen. In pure cultures of atrazine-degrading bacteria, as well as active soil communitites, atrazine ring nitrogen, but not carbon are assimilated into microbial biomass. Low concentrations of glucose can decrease the bioavailability, whereas higher concentrations promote the catabolism of atrazine. Tyrone Hayes, Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, notes that all of the studies that failed to conclude that atrazine caused hermaphroditism were plagued by poor experimental controls and were funded by Syngenta, one of the companies that produce the chemical. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its independent Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) examined all available studies on this topic including Hayes' work and concluded that there are 'currently insufficient data' to determine if atrazine affects amphibian development. Hayes, formerly part of the SAP panel, resigned in 2000 to continue studies independently. The EPA and its SAP made recommendations concerning proper study design needed for further investigation into this issue. As required by the EPA, Syngenta conducted two experiments under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and inspection by the EPA and German regulatory authorities. The paper concluded 'These studies demonstrate that long-term exposure of larval X. laevis to atrazine at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 microg/l does not affect growth, larval development, or sexual differentiation.' Another independent study in 2008 determined that 'the failure of recent studies to find that atrazine feminizes X. laevis calls into question the herbicide's role in that decline.' A report written in Environmental Science and Technology (May 15, 2008) cites the independent work of researchers in Japan, who were unable to replicate Hayes' work. 'The scientists found no hermaphrodite frogs; no increase in aromatase as measured by aromatase mRNA induction; and no increase in vitellogenin, another marker of feminization.'",CHEMBL15063

Its sulfonic acid is often present in the urine of many mammals. Small amounts of catechol occur naturally in fruits and vegetables, along with the enzyme polyphenol oxidase. Upon mixing the enzyme with the substrate and exposure to oxygen (as when a potato or apple is cut), the colorless catechol oxidizes to reddish-brown benzoquinone derivatives. The enzyme is inactivated by adding an acid, such as lemon juice, or by refrigeration. Excluding oxygen also prevents the browning reaction. Catechol melts at 28 oC and boils at 250 oC.

Used as a moth repellent, fumigant, lubricants, and to make other chemicals, and for many other uses This molecule is an aromatic hydrocarbon comprising two fused benzene rings. It occurs in the essential oils of numerous plant species e.g. magnolia. It has a role as a volatile oil component, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a carcinogenic agent, a mouse metabolite and an apoptosis inhibitor. It is an ortho-fused bicyclic arene and a member of naphthalenes. This molecule is used in the production of phthalic anhydride; it is also used in mothballs. Acute (short- term) exposure of humans to naphthalene by inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact is associated with hemolytic anemia, damage to the liver, and neurological damage. Cataracts have also been reported in workers acutely exposed to naphthalene by inhalation and ingestion. Chronic (long-term) exposure of workers and rodents to naphthalene has been reported to cause cataracts and damage to the retina. Hemolytic anemia has been reported in infants born to mothers who ""sniffed"" and ingested naphthalene (as mothballs) during pregnancy. Available data are inadequate to establish a causal relationship between exposure to naphthalene and cancer in humans. EPA has classified naphthalene as a Group C, possible human carcinogen. This molecule is a white, volatile, solid polycyclic hydrocarbon with a strong mothball odor. This molecule is obtained from either coal tar or petroleum distillation and is primarily used to manufacture phthalic anhydride, but is also used in moth repellents. Exposure to naphthalene is associated with hemolytic anemia, damage to the liver and neurological system, cataracts and retinal hemorrhage. This molecule is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen and may be associated with an increased risk of developing laryngeal and colorectal cancer. (NCI05) This molecule is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This molecule is a natural product found in Herbertus norenus, Swertia japonica, and other organisms with data available. This molecule is the simplest polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of two fused benzene rings. It has a distinct, pungent odor that can be detected at levels as low as 0.08 ppm.  This molecule is the most abundant single component of coal tar so most of it is now industrially derived from coal tar. From the 1960s until the 1990s, significant amounts of naphthalene were also produced from heavy petroleum fractions during petroleum refining, but today petroleum-derived naphthalene represents only a minor component of naphthalene production. This molecule is also produced naturally with trace amounts of naphthalene being produced by black walnuts, magnolias and specific types of deer, as well as the Formosan subterranean termite. Some strains of the endophytic fungus (Muscodor albus) also produce naphthalene. This molecule and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are released from incomplete combustion processes originating in industry, cigarette smoke and motor vehicle exhaust, as well as natural events such as forest fires. Industrially, naphthalene is used in the production of phthalic anhydride, as a solvent for chemical reactions, as a wetting agent and as a fumigant.  It is also used in pyrotechnic special effects such as the generation of black smoke and simulated explosions. In the past, naphthalene was administered orally to kill parasitic worms in livestock. This molecule was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, though its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a sealed container containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels that are toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths. This molecule has been shown to exhibit apoptotic and catabolic functions (4, 5). Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may damage or destroy red blood cells. Humans, in particular children, have developed this condition, known as hemolytic anemia, after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene.",CHEMBL16293

In the past, it was used in large amounts to produce other chemicals, as an industrial solvent to clean and degrease metals, and as an ingredient in paints and pesticides. Commercial production of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane for these uses has stopped in the United States. It presently is used only as a chemical intermediate in the production of other chemicals. This molecule is a colorless to pale yellow liquid with a sweet odor. Sinks in water. (USCG, 1999) This molecule is a member of the class of chloroethanes that is ethane substituted by chloro groups at positions 1, 1, 2 and 2. This molecule is no longer used much in the United States, current air emissions predominantly result from its use as a chemical intermediate during the manufacture of other chemicals. Low levels have been detected in air. The main effects of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane are liver and neurological effects. Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to very high levels of 1,1,2,2- tetrachloroethane has resulted in effects on the liver and respiratory, central nervous, and gastrointestinal systems in humans. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane in humans results in jaundice and an enlarged liver, headaches, tremors, dizziness, numbness, and drowsiness. Animal studies have shown a significantly increased incidence of liver tumors in mice orally exposed to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. EPA has classified 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane as a Group C possible human carcinogen. This molecule is a natural product found in Cystoseira barbata with data available. This molecule is a chlorinated derivative of ethane. It has the highest solvent power of any chlorinated hydrocarbon. As a refrigerant, it is used under the name R-130. It was once widely used as a solvent and as an intermediate in the industrial production of trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and 1,2-dichloroethylene. This molecule was also used to separate fats and oils from other substances, to clean and degrease metals, and in paints and pesticides. However, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is no longer used much in the United States due to concerns about its toxicity. Less toxic chemicals are now available to replace this solvent, and largescale commercial production has stopped, although some production still occurs (L336, L338).",CHEMBL47258

One of these forms, gamma-HCH (or γ-HCH, commonly called lindane) is produced and used as an insecticide on fruit, vegetables, and forest crops. It is a white solid that may evaporate into the air as a colorless vapor with a slightly musty odor. It is also available as a prescription (lotion, cream, or shampoo) to treat head and body lice, and scabies. Lindane has not been produced in the United States since 1976, but is imported for insecticide use. Technical-grade HCH was used as an insecticide in the United States and typically contained 10-15% gamma-HCH as well as the alpha (α), beta (β), delta (δ), and epsilon (ε) forms of HCH. Virtually all the insecticidal properties resided in gamma-HCH. Technical-grade HCH has not been produced or used in the United States in over 20 years. This molecule appears as white to yellow powder or flakes. Musty odor. The gamma isomer is known as lindane, a systemic insecticide. Toxic by ingestion or inhalation. This molecule is the beta-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane. It has a role as a persistent organic pollutant. It is an organochlorine pesticide and a hexachlorocyclohexane. This molecule is a potent enzyme in gastric juice that digests proteins such as those in meat, eggs, seeds, and dairy products.  Studies on gastric digestion from 1820-1840 led to the discovery of pepsin as the substance which, in the presence of stomach acid, causes nutrients including meat or coagulated egg whites to dissolve. Soon afterward, it was shown that these protein nutrients were cleaved by pepsin to products called peptones.  This molecule is often used as a replacement enzyme for those with pancreatic insufficiency. Stimulation of the pancreas and therefore enzymatic digestion of food is a tightly controlled and is a hormonally mediated process. Any changes or conditions affecting metabolic steps for successful digestion and absorption negatively affect pancreatic enzymatic secretion, entry into the intestine, functionality once inside the intestine, and appropriate mixing with foods/nutrients. Many causes of pancreatic insufficiency require that enzyme replacement therapy is started, including cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic surgery.  This molecule is approved by the FDA and is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice. Interestingly, it has been used as a marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), which is a common illness of otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat specialist) visits.  Interestingly, recent research has suggested that pepsin participates in the digestion of nucleic acids. An organochlorine insecticide that has been used as a pediculicide and a scabicide. Lindane has been banned in California, United Kingdom, Australia, and many western countries due to concerns about neurotoxicity and adverse effects on the environment. In Canada, Lindane is not recommmended as a first-line therapy due to reports of resistance, neurotoxicity, and bone marrow suppression, but has been approved by the FDA as a second-line therapy for topical treatment of pediculosis capitis (head lice), pediculosis pubis (pubic lice), or scabies in patients greater than two years of age who cannot tolerate or have failed first-line treatment.

(USCG, 1999) This molecule is a cresol with the methyl substituent at position 3. It is a minor urinary metabolite of toluene. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. This molecule is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This molecule is a natural product found in Geosmithia langdonii, Daphne odora, and other organisms with data available. This molecule is an isomer of p-cresol and o-cresol. Cresols are organic compounds which are methylphenols. They are a widely occurring natural and manufactured group of aromatic organic compounds which are categorized as phenols (sometimes called phenolics). Depending on the temperature, cresols can be solid or liquid because they have melting points not far from room temperature. Like other types of phenols, they are slowly oxidized by long exposure to air and the impurities often give cresols a yellowish to brownish red tint. Cresols have an odor characteristic to that of other simple phenols, reminiscent to some of a medicine smell. Cresol solutions are used as household cleaners and disinfectants, perhaps most famously under the trade name Lysol. In the past, cresol solutions have been used as antiseptics in surgery, but they have been largely displaced in this role by less toxic compounds. Lysol was also advertised as a disinfecting vaginal douche in mid-twentieth century America. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in brown mixtures such as creosote and cresylic acids, which are wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Most exposures to cresols are at very low levels that are not harmful. When cresols are breathed, ingested, or applied to the skin at very high levels, they can be very harmful. Effects observed in people include irritation and burning of skin, eyes, mouth, and throat; abdominal pain and vomiting; heart damage; anemia; liver and kidney damage; facial paralysis; coma; and death. Breathing high levels of cresols for a short time results in irritation of the nose and throat. Aside from these effects, very little is known about the effects of breathing cresols, for example, at lower levels over longer times. Ingesting high levels results in kidney problems, mouth and throat burns, abdominal pain, vomiting, and effects on the blood and nervous system. Skin contact with high levels of cresols can burn the skin and damage the kidneys, liver, blood, brain, and lungs. (wikipedia).",CHEMBL298312

Pure pentachlorophenol exists as colorless crystals. Impure pentachlorophenol (the form usually found at hazardous waste sites) is dark gray to brown and exists as dust, beads, or flakes. Humans are usually exposed to impure pentachlorophenol (also called technical grade pentachlorophenol). This molecule was widely used as a pesticide and wood preservative. Since 1984, the purchase and use of pentachlorophenol has been restricted to certified applicators. It is no longer available to the general public. It is still used industrially as a wood preservative for utility poles, railroad ties, and wharf pilings. This molecule appears as a white crystalline solid. Slightly soluble in water. Noncombustible. Toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and skin absorption. Used as a fungicide and as a wood preservative. This molecule is a chlorophenol that is phenol substituted by 5 chloro groups. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is an organochlorine pesticide, a member of pentachlorobenzenes, an aromatic fungicide and a chlorophenol. It is functionally related to a pentachlorobenzene. It is a conjugate acid of a pentachlorophenolate. This molecule was once one of the most widely used biocides in the United States, but it is now a restricted use pesticide and is no longer available to the general public. It was primarily used as a wood preservative. This molecule is extremely toxic to humans from acute (short-term) ingestion and inhalation exposure. Acute inhalation exposures in humans have resulted in neurological, blood, and liver effects, and eye irritation. Chronic (long-term) exposure to pentachlorophenol by inhalation in humans has resulted in effects on the respiratory tract, blood, kidney, liver, immune system, eyes, nose, and skin. Human studies are inconclusive regarding pentachlorophenol exposure and reproductive effects. Human studies suggest an association between exposure to pentachlorophenol and cancer. Oral animal studies have reported increases in liver tumors and two uncommon tumor types. EPA has classified pentachlorophenol as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen. This molecule is a natural product found in Bos taurus with data available. This molecule is an organochlorine compound used as a pesticide and a disinfectant. First produced in the 1930s, it is marketed under many trade names. It can be found in two forms: PCP itself or as the sodium salt of PCP, which dissolves easily in water. Short-term exposure to large amounts of PCP can cause harmful effects on the liver, kidneys, blood, lungs, nervous system, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract. Elevated temperature, profuse sweating, uncoordinated movement, muscle twitching, and coma are additional side effects. Contact with PCP (particularly in the form of vapor) can irritate the skin, eyes, and mouth. Long-term exposure to low levels such as those that occur in the workplace can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and nervous system. Finally exposure to PCP is also associated with carcinogenic, renal, and neurological effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Class classifies PCP in group B2 (probable human carcinogen).",CHEMBL75967

Unpleasant taste with metallic or garlic aftertaste. pH of a solution obtained by shaking 1 g with 30 mL of water is 6 to 8. (NTP, 1992) This molecule is an alcohol deterrent used as an adjunct to treatment of chronic alcoholism, based upon its ability to cause an aversive reaction when taken with alcohol. This molecule has been associated with a low rate of with serum aminotransferase elevations during chronic therapy and has been linked to clinically apparent acute liver injury which can be severe and result in fatality. This molecule is an organic disulfide that results from the formal oxidative dimerisation of N,N-diethyldithiocarbamic acid. A multi-enzyme inhibitor that is used in alcohol aversion therapy and also exhibits anticancer properties.

It is an organic disulfide and an organosulfur acaricide. A carbamate derivative used as an alcohol deterrent. It is a relatively nontoxic substance when administered alone, but markedly alters the intermediary metabolism of alcohol. When alcohol is ingested after administration of disulfiram, blood acetaldehyde concentrations are increased, followed by flushing, systemic vasodilation, respiratory difficulties, nausea, hypotension, and other symptoms (acetaldehyde syndrome). It acts by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase. This molecule is an Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of disulfiram is as an Acetyl Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Inhibitor. This molecule is an orally bioavailable carbamoyl derivative and a proteasome inhibitor that is used in the treatment of alcoholism, with potential antineoplastic and chemosensitizing activities. This molecule (DSF) may help to treat alcoholism by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that oxidizes the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde into acetic acid. Inhibition of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase leads to an accumulation of acetaldehyde and produces a variety of very unpleasant symptoms, which together are referred to as the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER). In addition, DSF has a strong ability to chelate metals and its antineoplastic activity is highly dependent upon binding to copper (Cu), a metal that selectively accumulates in cancer cells. DSF/Cu generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibits proteasome activity, leading to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins; both of these processes result in induction of apoptosis. Also, DSF/Cu inhibits various cancer-specific pathways, which leads to inhibition of tumor cell growth. This molecule is a natural product found in Coprinopsis atramentaria with data available. A carbamate derivative used as an alcohol deterrent. It is a relatively nontoxic substance when administered alone, but markedly alters the intermediary metabolism of alcohol.

It is a colorless, nonflammable gas with no distinct smell. Other names for bromomethane are methyl bromide, mono-bromomethane, and methyl fume. Trade names include Embafume and Terabol. This molecule is used to kill a variety of pests including rats, insects, and fungi. It is also used to make other chemicals or as a solvent to get oil out of nuts, seeds, and wool. This molecule appears as colorless highly toxic volatile liquid or a gas. Boiling point 3.56 °C (38.41 °F). Usually odorless, but has a sweetish chloroform-like odor at high concentrations. Used as an insecticide, a rodenticide, a fumigant, a nematocide, a chemical intermediate and as a fire extinguishing agent. (EPA, 1998) This molecule is a one-carbon compound in which the carbon is attached by single bonds to three hydrogen atoms and one bromine atom. It is produced naturally by marine algae. It has a role as a fumigant insecticide, a marine metabolite and an algal metabolite. It is a member of methyl halides, a member of bromomethanes and a bromohydrocarbon. This molecule is used as a fumigant and pesticide. Exposure may occur during fumigation activities. This molecule is highly toxic. Studies in humans indicate that the lung may be severely injured by the acute (short-term) inhalation of methyl bromide. Acute and chronic (long-term) inhalation of methyl bromide can lead to neurological effects in humans. Neurological effects have also been reported in animals. Degenerative and proliferative lesions in the nasal cavity developed in rats chronically exposed to methyl bromide by inhalation. Chronic inhalation exposure of male animals has resulted in effects on the testes at high concentrations. EPA has classified methyl bromide as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. This molecule is a methyl halide, bromomethane, and bromohydrocarbon that is composed of one carbon, one hydrogen, and three bromine atoms. It is both manufactured and naturally produced by marine algae, and it has a role as a pesticide, a fire extinguishing agent, and in the synthesis of other chemicals. It is characterized as a colorless gas with a chloroform-like odor at high concentrations. Exposure occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or contact. This molecule is an organobromide compound that may be produced both synthetically and by naturally marine organisms and certain terrestrial plants. It was used extensively as a pesticide and as a fire extinguisher component until being phased out by most countries in the early 2000s, as it is considered an ozone-depleting substance. The primary use of methyl bromide is/was as a fumigant in soil to control fungi, nematodes, and weeds; in space fumigation of food commodities (e.g., grains); and in storage facilities (such as mills, warehouses, vaults, ships, and freight cars) to control insects and rodents. Its popularity as a fumigant is largely attributable to its high toxicity to many pests, the variety of settings in which it can be applied, its ability to penetrate the fumigated substances, and its rapid dissipation following application. Trace amounts of methyl bromide have been detected in drinking water.  There are many reports of humans who have died following acute inhalation exposure to bromomethane. Most cases have involved accidental exposures associated with manufacturing or packaging operations, use of fire extinguishers containing bromomethane, or fumigation activities. Death is not immediate, but usually occurs within l-2 days of exposure. The cause of death is not certain, but is probably due to neurological and lung injury.",CHEMBL48339

This molecule is highly toxic to humans when absorbed through the skin, inhaled as vapor, or swallowed. Acute (short-term) exposure of humans to o- toluidine affects the blood (i.e., methemoglobinemia), with clinical signs of central nervous system depression. The chronic (long-term) effects in workers exposed to o-toluidine include anemia, anorexia, weight loss, skin lesions, central nervous system depression, cyanosis, and methemoglobinemia. Animal studies indicate that chronic exposure too-toluidine causes effects on the spleen, liver, urinary bladder, and blood. Occupational exposure to dyestuffs (including o-toluidine) is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. 2-Methylaniline hydrochloride (the hydrochloride salt of o-toluidine) was carcinogenic in rats and mice.

Four studies of workers exposed to o-toluidine reported an excess of bladder cancers. This molecule and o-toluidine hydrochloride are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens. (NCI05) This molecule is a natural product found in Camellia sinensis with data available. These molecules are quite similar to those of aniline and toluidines have properties in common with other aromatic amines. Due to the amino group bonded to the aromatic ring, the toluidines are weakly basic. None of the toluidines is very soluble in pure water, but will become soluble if the aqueous solution is acidic due to formation of ammonium salts, as usual for organic amines. At room temperature and pressure, ortho- and meta-toluidines are viscous liquids, but para-toluidine is a flaky solid. This can be explained by the fact that the p-toluidine molecules are more symmetrical and fit into a crystalline structure more easily. p-Toluidine can be obtained from reduction of p-nitrotoluene. p-Toluidine reacts with formaldehyde to form Troger's base.",CHEMBL1381

This molecule is a primary arylamine in which an amino functional group is substituted for one of the benzene hydrogens. It is a primary arylamine and a member of anilines. This molecule is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NH2. Consisting of an amine attached to a benzene ring, aniline is the prototypical aromatic amine. Being a precursor to many industrial chemicals, its main use is in the manufacture of precursors to polyurethane. Like most volatile amines, it possesses the somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish. Aniline is colorless, but it slowly oxidizes and resinifies in air, giving a red-brown tint to aged samples. This molecule is produced or used. The acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) effects of aniline in humans consist mainly of effects on the lung, such as upper respiratory tract irritation and congestion. Chronic exposure may also result in effects on the blood.

EPA has classified aniline as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen. This molecule is a natural product found in Camellia sinensis and Trigonella foenum-graecum with data available. This molecule is an organic chemical compound, specifically a primary aromatic amine. It consists of a benzene ring attached to an amino group. This molecule is oily and, although colorless, it can be slowly oxidized and resinified in air to form impurities which can give it a red-brown tint. Its boiling point is 184 degree centigrade and its melting point is -6 degree centegrade. It is a liquid at room temperature. Like most volatile amines, it possesses a somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish, and also has a burning aromatic taste; it is a highly acrid poison. It ignites readily, burning with a large smoky flame. This molecule reacts with strong acids to form salts containing the anilinium (or phenylammonium) ion (C6H5-NH3+), and reacts with acyl halides (such as acetyl chloride (ethanoyl chloride), CH3COCl) to form amides. The amides formed from aniline are sometimes called anilides, for example CH3-CO-NH-C6H5 is acetanilide, for which the modern name is N-phenyl ethanamide. Like phenols, aniline derivatives are highly reactive in electrophilic substitution reactions. For example, sulfonation of aniline produces sulfanilic acid, which can be converted to sulfanilamide. Sulfanilamide is one of the sulfa drugs which were widely used as antibacterial in the early 20th century. This molecule was first isolated from the destructive distillation of indigo in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben. In 1834, Friedrich Runge isolated from coal tar a substance which produced a beautiful blue color on treatment with chloride of lime; this he named kyanol or cyanol. In 1841, C. J. Fritzsche showed that by treating indigo with caustic potash it yielded an oil, which he named aniline, from the specific name of one of the indigo-yielding plants, Indigofera anil, anil being derived from the Sanskrit, dark-blue.",CHEMBL538

This molecule is used as a starting point to other specialty chemicals. This molecule is a heterocyclic organic compound, consisting of a five-membered aromatic ring with four carbon atoms and one oxygen. The class of compounds containing such rings are also referred to as furans. This molecule is aromatic because one of the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom is delocalized into the ring, creating a 4n+2 aromatic system (see Huckel's rule) similar to benzene. Because of the aromaticity, the molecule is flat and lacks discrete double bonds. The other lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom extends in the plane of the flat ring system. The sp2 hybridization is to allow one of the lone pairs of oxygen to reside in a p orbital and thus allow it to interact within the pi-system. The Feist-Benary synthesis is a classic way to synthesize furans, although many syntheses have been developed. One of the simplest synthesis methods for furans is the reaction of 1,4-diketones with phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) in the Paal-Knorr Synthesis. The thiophene formation reaction of 1,4-diketones with Lawesson's reagent also forms furans as side products. 2,4-Disubstituted furans can be synthesized by sulfone-mediated cyclization of 1,3-diketones",CHEMBL278980

It was introduced by Bayer in 1954 under the trade name of Diuron. DCMU is a very specific and sensitive inhibitor of photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light, water, and carbon di-oxide from the atmosphere to form plant sugars and cellulose. Diuron blocks electron transport at a critical point in this process. It blocks the plastoquinone binding site of photosystem II, disallowing the electron flow from where it is generated, in photosystem II, to plastoquinone. This interrupts the photosynthetic electron transport chain in photosynthesis and thus reduces the ability of the plant to turn light energy into chemical energy (ATP and reductant potential).",CHEMBL278489

Cardiac arrhythmia and respiratory arrest may result from the depression of the CNS. Symptoms of acute inhalation exposure include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness, and decreased blood pressure in humans. After chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to methyl chloroform, some liver damage was observed in mice and ventricular arrhythmias in humans. EPA has classified methyl chloroform as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. This molecule is generally considered as a polar solvent. Owing to its unsymmetrical structure, it is a superior solvent for organic compounds that do not dissolve well in hydrocarbons such as hexane. It is an excellent solvent for many organic materials and also one of the least toxic of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Prior to the Montreal Protocol, it was widely used for cleaning metal parts and circuit boards, as a photoresist solvent in the electronics industry, as an aerosol propellant, as a cutting fluid additive, and as a solvent for inks, paints, adhesives and other coatings. This molecule is marketed with stabilizers since it is unstable with respect to dehydrochlorination and attacks some metals. Stabilizers comprise up to 8% of the formulation, including acid scavengers (epoxides, amines) and complexants. The Montreal Protocol targeted 1,1,1-trichloroethane as one of those compounds responsible for ozone depletion and banned its use beginning in 1996. Since then, its manufacture and use has been phased out throughout most of the world. The organic compound 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also known as methyl chloroform, is a chloroalkane.

This molecule is a natural product found in Spiranthes vernalis, Phomopsis velata, and other organisms with data available. This molecule is an aromatic organic compound which is a type of phenol. Hydroquinone is commonly used as a biomarker for benzene exposure. The presence of hydroquinone in normal individuals stems mainly from direct dietary ingestion, catabolism of tyrosine and other substrates by gut bacteria, ingestion of arbutin containing foods, cigarette smoking, and the use of some over-the-counter medicines. In human medicine, hydroquinone is used as a topical application in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations. The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen. This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell adenomas. Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin, if taken orally; however, skin preparations containing the ingredient are administered topically. The FDA has classified hydroquinone currently as a safe product, as currently used. (Wikipedia)",CHEMBL537

Vapors heavier than air. Used as a solvent and to make other chemicals. This molecule is an alkylbenzene carrying an ethyl substituent. It is a constituent of coal tar and petroleum. This molecule is mainly used in the manufacture of styrene. Acute (short-term) exposure to ethylbenzene in humans results in respiratory effects, such as throat irritation and chest constriction, irritation of the eyes, and neurological effects such as dizziness. Chronic (long-term) exposure to ethylbenzene by inhalation in humans has shown conflicting results regarding its effects on the blood. Animal studies have reported effects on the blood, liver, and kidneys from chronic inhalation exposure to ethylbenzene. Limited information is available on the carcinogenic effects of ethylbenzene in humans. In a study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), exposure to ethylbenzene by inhalation resulted in an increased incidence of kidney and testicular tumors in rats, and lung and liver tumors in mice. EPA has classified ethylbenzene as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. This molecule is an aromatic hydrocarbon composed of a benzene ring linked to an ethyl group. This molecule is a constituent of petroleum and coal tar and is used as either a petroleum additive or a chemical intermediate in the production of polystyrene.

(NTP, 1992) This molecule is a widely used nonprescription analgesic and antipyretic medication for mild-to-moderate pain and fever. Harmless at low doses, acetaminophen has direct hepatotoxic potential when taken as an overdose and can cause acute liver injury and death from acute liver failure. Even in therapeutic doses, acetaminophen can cause transient serum aminotransferase elevations. This molecule is a member of the class of phenols that is 4-aminophenol in which one of the hydrogens attached to the amino group has been replaced by an acetyl group. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a non-narcotic analgesic, an antipyretic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a cyclooxygenase 3 inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a human blood serum metabolite, a hepatotoxic agent, a ferroptosis inducer and a geroprotector. It is a member of phenols and a member of acetamides. It is functionally related to a 4-aminophenol. This molecule is the most commonly taken analgesic worldwide and is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is also used for its antipyretic effects, helping to reduce fever. This drug was initially approved by the U.S. FDA in 1951 and is available in a variety of forms including syrup form, regular tablets, effervescent tablets, injection, suppository, and other forms.  Acetaminophen is often found combined with other drugs in more than 600 over the counter (OTC) allergy medications, cold medications, sleep medications, pain relievers, and other products. Confusion about dosing of this drug may be caused by the availability of different formulas, strengths, and dosage instructions for children of different ages. Due to the possibility of fatal overdose and liver failure associated with the incorrect use of acetaminophen, it is important to follow current and available national and manufacturer dosing guidelines while this drug is taken or prescribed. This molecule is a p-aminophenol derivative with analgesic and antipyretic activities. Although the exact mechanism through which acetaminophen exert its effects has yet to be fully determined, acetaminophen may inhibit the nitric oxide (NO) pathway mediated by a variety of neurotransmitter receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and substance P, resulting in elevation of the pain threshold. The antipyretic activity may result from inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and release in the central nervous system (CNS) and prostaglandin-mediated effects on the heat-regulating center in the anterior hypothalamus. This molecule is a natural product found in Streptomyces xiamenensis and Euglena gracilis with data available. This molecule is commonly used for its analgesic and antipyretic effects. Its therapeutic effects are similar to salicylates, but it lacks anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and gastric ulcerative effects. The excellent tolerability of therapeutic doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a major factor in the very wide use of the drug. The major problem in the use of paracetamol is its hepatotoxicity after an overdose. Hepatotoxicity has also been reported after therapeutic doses, but critical analysis indicates that most patients with alleged toxicity from therapeutic doses have taken overdoses. Importantly, prospective studies indicate that therapeutic doses of paracetamol are an unlikely cause of hepatotoxicity in patients who ingest moderate to large amounts of alcohol. (A7820). Single doses of paracetamol are effective analgesics for acute postoperative pain and give rise to few adverse effects. (A7821). Acetaminophen (AAP) overdose and the resulting hepatotoxicity is an important clinical problem. In addition, AAP is widely used as a prototype hepatotoxin to study mechanisms of chemical-induced cell injury and to test the hepatoprotective potential of new drugs and herbal medicines. Because of its importance, the mechanisms of AAP-induced liver cell injury have been extensively investigated and controversially discussed for many years. (A7822).",CHEMBL112

This molecule is a colorless odorless gas. It is also known as marsh gas or methyl hydride. It is easily ignited. The vapors are lighter than air. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. It is used in making other chemicals and as a constituent of the fuel, natural gas. This molecule is a colorless odorless liquid. Flammable. Water insoluble. This molecule appears as a flammable gaseous mixture of straight chain hydrocarbons, predominately compressed methane. This molecule is a one-carbon compound in which the carbon is attached by single bonds to four hydrogen atoms. It is a colourless, odourless, non-toxic but flammable gas (b.p. -161℃). It has a role as a fossil fuel, a member of greenhouse gas and a bacterial metabolite. It is a mononuclear parent hydride, a one-carbon compound, a gas molecular entity and an alkane. It is a conjugate acid of a methanide. This molecule is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655). This molecule is a natural product found in Dioon spinulosum, Stangeria eriopus, and other organisms with data available. This molecule is a gas produced by a group of colonic anaerobes, absorbed from the colon and excreted in expired air. As a result, breath CH4 excretion can be used as an indicator of the in situ activity of the methanogenic flora. All CH4 produced in human beings is a metabolic product of intestinal bacteria, and about 50% of CH4 produced in the gut is absorbed and excreted in expired air. Because there appears to be no catabolism of this gas by other colonic organisms or host cells, breath CH4 measurements provide a rapid, simple means of semi quantitatively assessing the ongoing in situ metabolism of the methanogenic flora. It could seem likely that the intracolonic activity of a variety of bacteria similarly might be assessed quantitatively via analysis of expired air. However, the application of this methodology has been confounded by the rapid catabolism of many volatile bacterial products by other bacteria or human tissue. A striking aspect of the studies of breath CH4 measurements is the enormous individual variations in the excretion of this gas. Virtually all children under 5 years of age and 66% of the adult population do not exhale appreciable quantities of CH4. The remaining 34% of the adult population has appreciable breath methane concentrations of up to 80 ppm (mean, 15.2 ppm; median, 11.8 ppm). On this basis the population can be divided into CH4 producers or nonproducers, although a more accurate term would be to define subjects as being low or high CH4 producers. The primary methanogen present in the human colon, Methanobrevibacter smithii, produces methane via a reaction that relies entirely on H2 produced by other organisms to reduce CO2 to CH4. Thus, breath CH4 concentrations might be expected to mirror breath H2 concentrations; however, the high levels of CH4 observed in the fasting state may result from H2 derived from endogenous rather than dietary substrates. A diverse assortment of conditions has been associated with a high prevalence of methane producers including diverticulosis, cystic fibrosis, high fasting serum cholesterol levels, encopresis in children, and aorto-iliac vascular disease, whereas obesity (measured as skin-fold thickness) was related inversely to methane production. The challenge that remains is to determine to what extent methanogens actively influence body physiology vs. simply serve as passive indicators of colonic function. (A11043)",CHEMBL17564

This molecule is a volatile liquid prepared by fermentation of certain carbohydrates. This molecule acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. This molecule inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.

Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. This molecule has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. This molecule has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. This molecule is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. This molecule within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption.

(USCG, 1999) This molecule is a cresol that consists of toluene substituted by a hydroxy group at position 4. It is a metabolite of aromatic amino acid metabolism produced by intestinal microflora in humans and animals. It has a role as a uremic toxin, a human metabolite and an Escherichia coli metabolite. This molecule is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655). This molecule is a natural product found in Artemisia macrocephala, Viburnum cylindricum, and other organisms with data available. This molecule is a phenol. It is a partially lipophilic moiety which strongly binds to plasma protein (close to 100%) under normal conditions. p-Cresol is metabolized through conjugation, mainly sulphation and glucuronization, but removal of the unconjugated p-cresol is, at least in part, via the urine. Therefore it is not surprising that this compound, together with several other phenoles, is retained when the kidneys fail. P-Cresol is an end-product of protein breakdown, and an increase of the nutritional protein load in healthy individuals results in enhanced generation and urinary excretion. The serum p-cresol concentration in uremic patients can be decreased by changing to a low-protein diet. p-Cresol is one of the metabolites of the amino acid tyrosine, and to a certain extent also of phenylalanine, which are converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by intestinal bacteria, before being decarboxylated to p-cresol (putrefaction). The main contributing bacteria are aerobes (mainly enterobacteria), but to a certain extent also anaerobes play a role (mainly Clostridium perfringens). In uremia, modifications in the intestinal flora result in the specific overgrowth of bacteria that are specific p-cresol producers. The administration of antibiotics reduces urinary excretion of p-cresol, as a result of the liquidation of the producing bacteria. Environmental factors might also contribute. The liver cytochrome P450 metabolizes toluene to benzyl alcohol, but also to o-cresol and p-cresol. Toluene is not only used industrially, but it is also the most widely abusively inhaled solvent. Furthermore, p-cresol is a metabolite of menthofuran, one of the metabolites of R-(+)-pulegone, which is found in extracts from the plants Mentha pulegium and Hedeoma pulegioides, commonly known as pennyroyal oil and pennyroyal tea. These extracts are popular as unconventional herbal therapeutic agents and are applied as abortiva, diaphoretics, emmenagogues, and psychedelic drugs. Pennyroyal oil is extensively used for its pleasant mint-like smell in the flavoring industry. The toxicity of pennyroyal oil and menthofuran is well known. Another compound used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, which is a precursor of p-cresol is wood tar creosote. p-Cresol has been reported to affect several biochemical, biological and physiological functions: (i) it diminishes the oxygen uptake of rat cerebral cortex slices; (ii) it increases the free active drug concentration of warfarin and diazepam; (iii) it has been related to growth retardation in the weanling pig; (iv) it alters cell membrane permeability, at least in bacteria; (v) it induces LDH leakage from rat liver slices; (vi) it induces susceptibility to auditive epileptic crises; and (vii) it blocks cell K+ channels. (A7723). p-Cresol is a uremic toxin that is at least partially removed by peritoneal dialysis in haemodialysis patients, and has been involved in the progression of renal failure. (MID: 11169029). At concentrations encountered during uremia, p-cresol inhibits phagocyte function and decreases leukocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. (A3274).",CHEMBL16645
