CCCC(C)C,1,"Watery liquid with a gasoline-like odor, Floats on water. Produces an irritating vapor. (USCG, 1999) This molecule appears as colorless liquid. Isomers (2-methyl, 3-methyl) are possible and present in technical mixtures or singly for research purposes. Used in organic synthesis and as a solvent. This molecule is an alkane. This molecule is a natural product found in Solanum lycopersicum and Vitis rotundifolia with data available. This molecule is an isomer of hexane. Hexane is a chemical made from crude oil. It is highly flammable, and its vapors can be explosive. Pure hexane is used in laboratories. Most of the hexane used in industry is mixed with similar chemicals called solvents. The major use for solvents containing hexane is to extract vegetable oils from crops such as soybeans. These solvents are also used as cleaning agents in the printing, textile, furniture, and shoemaking industries. Certain kinds of special glues used in the roofing and shoe and leather industries also contain hexane. Several consumer products contain hexane, such as gasoline, quick-drying glues used in various hobbies, and rubber cement. (L175)"
C[C@H](N)Cc1ccccc1,1,"This molecule is a 1-phenylpropan-2-amine that has S configuration. It has a role as a neurotoxin, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, a dopaminergic agent, a sympathomimetic agent, a dopamine uptake inhibitor and an adrenergic agent. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-amphetamine. This molecule is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of amphetamine. This molecule was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This molecule is a Central Nervous System Stimulant. The physiologic effect of dextroamphetamine is by means of Central Nervous System Stimulation. This molecule is a synthetic substance related to natural sympathomimetic amines and the synthetic agent amphetamine. In the central nervous system (CNS), dextroamphetamine induces the release of dopamine within the mesocorticolimbic system, a major component of the brain reward system, resulting in measurable behavioral changes such as euphoria. As a CNS stimulant, this agent may increase blood pressure and reduce appetite. Similar to other amphetamines, dextroamphetamine has a high potential for abuse, dependence, and addiction if used in large doses over extended periods of time. (NCI04) This molecule is a natural product found in Vachellia rigidula with data available. This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is the dextrorotary stereoisomer of the amphetamine molecule, which can take two different forms. It is a slightly polar, weak base and is lipophilic. The exact mechanism of action is not known. This molecule stimulates the release of norepinephrine from central adrenergic receptors. At higher dosages, it causes release of dopamine from the mesocorticolimbic system and the nigrostriatal dopamine systems by reversal of the monoamine transporters. This molecule may also act as a direct agonist on central 5-HT receptors and may inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO). In the periphery, amphetamines are believed to cause the release of noradrenaline by acting on the adrenergic nerve terminals and alpha- and beta-receptors. Modulation of serotonergic pathways may contribute to the calming affect."

CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1,1,"This molecule is an odorless white crystalline solid. Bitter taste. pH (saturated aqueous solution) about 6. (NTP, 1992) This molecule is a widely used nonprescription analgesic and antipyretic medication for mild-to-moderate pain and fever. Harmless at low doses, acetaminophen has direct hepatotoxic potential when taken as an overdose and can cause acute liver injury and death from acute liver failure. Even in therapeutic doses, acetaminophen can cause transient serum aminotransferase elevations. This molecule is a member of the class of phenols that is 4-aminophenol in which one of the hydrogens attached to the amino group has been replaced by an acetyl group. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a non-narcotic analgesic, an antipyretic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a cyclooxygenase 3 inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a human blood serum metabolite, a hepatotoxic agent, a ferroptosis inducer and a geroprotector. It is a member of phenols and a member of acetamides. It is functionally related to a 4-aminophenol. This molecule is the most commonly taken analgesic worldwide and is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is also used for its antipyretic effects, helping to reduce fever. This drug was initially approved by the U.S. FDA in 1951 and is available in a variety of forms including syrup form, regular tablets, effervescent tablets, injection, suppository, and other forms.  Acetaminophen is often found combined with other drugs in more than 600 over the counter (OTC) allergy medications, cold medications, sleep medications, pain relievers, and other products. Confusion about dosing of this drug may be caused by the availability of different formulas, strengths, and dosage instructions for children of different ages. Due to the possibility of fatal overdose and liver failure associated with the incorrect use of acetaminophen, it is important to follow current and available national and manufacturer dosing guidelines while this drug is taken or prescribed. This molecule is a p-aminophenol derivative with analgesic and antipyretic activities. Although the exact mechanism through which acetaminophen exert its effects has yet to be fully determined, acetaminophen may inhibit the nitric oxide (NO) pathway mediated by a variety of neurotransmitter receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and substance P, resulting in elevation of the pain threshold. The antipyretic activity may result from inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and release in the central nervous system (CNS) and prostaglandin-mediated effects on the heat-regulating center in the anterior hypothalamus. This molecule is a natural product found in Streptomyces xiamenensis and Euglena gracilis with data available. This molecule is commonly used for its analgesic and antipyretic effects. Its therapeutic effects are similar to salicylates, but it lacks anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and gastric ulcerative effects. The excellent tolerability of therapeutic doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a major factor in the very wide use of the drug. The major problem in the use of paracetamol is its hepatotoxicity after an overdose. Hepatotoxicity has also been reported after therapeutic doses, but critical analysis indicates that most patients with alleged toxicity from therapeutic doses have taken overdoses. Importantly, prospective studies indicate that therapeutic doses of paracetamol are an unlikely cause of hepatotoxicity in patients who ingest moderate to large amounts of alcohol. (A7820). Single doses of paracetamol are effective analgesics for acute postoperative pain and give rise to few adverse effects. (A7821). Acetaminophen (AAP) overdose and the resulting hepatotoxicity is an important clinical problem. In addition, AAP is widely used as a prototype hepatotoxin to study mechanisms of chemical-induced cell injury and to test the hepatoprotective potential of new drugs and herbal medicines. Because of its importance, the mechanisms of AAP-induced liver cell injury have been extensively investigated and controversially discussed for many years. (A7822)."

It is being investigated for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency. This molecule is an alpha-Adrenergic Agonist, and beta-Adrenergic Agonist, and Catecholamine. The mechanism of action of epinephrine is as an Adrenergic alpha-Agonist, and Adrenergic beta-Agonist. This molecule is the synthetic form of the naturally occurring sympathomimetic amine with vasoconstricting, intraocular pressure-reducing, and bronchodilating activities. By stimulating vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine causes vasoconstriction, thereby increasing vascular resistance and blood pressure. When administered in the conjunctiva, this agent binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, a decrease in the production of aqueous humor, and a lowering of intraocular pressure. Through its beta1 receptor-stimulating actions, epinephrine increases the force and rate of myocardial contraction and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in bronchodilation. This molecule is a natural product found in Hemidesmus indicus, Portulaca grandiflora, and other organisms with data available."

CCN(CC)CCCC(C)Nc1ccnc2cc(Cl)ccc12,1,"This molecule is an aminoquinoline used for the prevention and therapy of malaria. It is also effective in extraintestinal amebiasis and as an antiinflammatory agent for therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. This molecule is not associated with serum enzyme elevations and is an extremely rare cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule is an aminoquinoline that is quinoline which is substituted at position 4 by a [5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]amino group at at position 7 by chlorine. It is used for the treatment of malaria, hepatic amoebiasis, lupus erythematosus, light-sensitive skin eruptions, and rheumatoid arthritis. It has a role as an antimalarial, an antirheumatic drug, a dermatologic drug, an autophagy inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is an aminoquinoline, a secondary amino compound, a tertiary amino compound and an organochlorine compound. It is a conjugate base of a chloroquine(2+). This molecule is an aminoquinolone derivative first developed in the 1940s for the treatment of malaria. It was the drug of choice to treat malaria until the development of newer antimalarials such as [pyrimethamine], [artemisinin], and [mefloquine]. This molecule and its derivative [hydroxychloroquine] have since been repurposed for the treatment of a number of other conditions including HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis.  **The FDA emergency use authorization for [hydroxychloroquine] and chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 was revoked on 15 June 2020.**  This molecule was granted FDA Approval on 31 October 1949. This molecule is an Antimalarial. This molecule is a 4-aminoquinoline with antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, and potential chemosensitization and radiosensitization activities. Although the mechanism is not well understood, chloroquine is shown to inhibit the parasitic enzyme heme polymerase that converts the toxic heme into non-toxic hemazoin, thereby resulting in the accumulation of toxic heme within the parasite. This agent may also interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids. This molecule's potential chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing activities in cancer may be related to its inhibition of autophagy, a cellular mechanism involving lysosomal degradation that minimizes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) related to tumor reoxygenation and tumor exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. This molecule is a natural product found in Cocos nucifera, Cinchona calisaya, and other organisms with data available. This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a prototypical antimalarial agent with a mechanism that is not well understood. It has also been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and in the systemic therapy of amebic liver abscesses. [PubChem]The mechanism of plasmodicidal action of chloroquine is not completely certain. Like other quinoline derivatives, it is thought to inhibit heme polymerase activity. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites. nside red blood cells, the malarial parasite must degrade hemoglobin to acquire essential amino acids, which the parasite requires to construct its own protein and for energy metabolism. Digestion is carried out in a vacuole of the parasite cell.During this process, the parasite produces the toxic and soluble molecule heme. The heme moiety consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP). To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form hemozoin, a non-toxic molecule. Hemozoin collects in the digestive vacuole as insoluble crystals.This molecule enters the red blood cell, inhabiting parasite cell, and digestive vacuole by simple diffusion. This molecule then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion. This molecule caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further biocrystallization of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. This molecule binds to heme (or FP) to form what is known as the FP-This molecule complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function. Action of the toxic FP-This molecule and FP results in cell lysis and ultimately parasite cell autodigestion. In essence, the parasite cell drowns in its own metabolic products."

This molecule is an ether compound having fluoromethyl and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropyl as the two alkyl groups. It has a role as an inhalation anaesthetic, a platelet aggregation inhibitor and a central nervous system depressant. It is an organofluorine compound and an ether. It is functionally related to a 2-methoxypropane. This molecule is an ether inhalation anesthetic agent used to induce and maintain general anesthesia. It is a volatile, non-flammable compound with a low solubility profile and blood/gas partition coefficient. This molecule was patented in 1972, was approved for clinical use in Japan in 1990, and approved by the FDA in 1996. This molecule is three times more potent than [desflurane], but has lower potency compared to [halothane] and [isoflurane]. Unlike other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane has a pleasant odor and does not irritate the airway. The hemodynamic and respiratory depressive effects of sevoflurane are well tolerated, and most patients receiving this anesthetic agent present little toxicity. Therefore, it can be used for inhalational induction in adults and children for a wide variety of anesthetic procedures. This molecule is a General Anesthetic. The physiologic effect of sevoflurane is by means of General Anesthesia. This molecule is a fluorinated isopropyl ether with general anesthetic property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, sevoflurane may act by interfering with the release and re-uptake of neurotransmitters at post-synaptic terminals, and/or alter ionic conductance following receptor activation by a neurotransmitter. This molecule may also interact directly with lipid matrix of neuronal membranes, thereby affecting gating properties of ion channels. In addition, this agent may activate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors hyperpolarizing cell membranes. This results in a general anesthetic effect, a decrease in myocardial contractility and mean arterial pressure as well as an increased respiratory rate. This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. This molecule (2,2,2-trifluoro-1-[trifluoromethyl]ethyl fluoromethyl ether), also called fluoromethyl, is a sweet-smelling, non-flammable, highly fluorinated methyl isopropyl ether used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Together with desflurane, it is replacing isoflurane and halothane in modern anesthesiology. [Wikipedia] This molecule induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. This molecule also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. It also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase and also binds to the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium channel, the glutamate receptor, and the glycine receptor."

In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that pirbuterol has a preferential effect on beta-2 Adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta-2 adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta-2 receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10-50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established.  The pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, including pirbuterol, are at least in proof attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (AlP) to cyclic-3† ,5†-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.

This molecule is a C21-steroid hormone in which a pregnane skeleton carries oxo substituents at positions 3 and 20 and is unsaturated at C(4)-C(5). As a hormone, it is involved in the female menstrual cycle, pregnancy and embryogenesis of humans and other species. It has a role as a contraceptive drug, a progestin, a progesterone receptor agonist, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a 20-oxo steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid and a C21-steroid hormone. It derives from a hydride of a pregnane. This molecule is a hormone that occurs naturally in females, and is essential for endometrial receptivity, embryo implantation, and the successful establishment of pregnancy. A low progesterone concentration or an insufficient response to progesterone can cause infertility and pregnancy loss. This molecule is used in various contraceptive preparations to prevent ovulation and fertilization, as well as in other formulations to promote and support pregnancy.  Please see [Medroxyprogesterone acetate], [Megestrol acetate], [Dydrogesterone] and [Hydroxyprogesterone] entries for information on various other forms of progesterone.  Pharmaceutical progesterone is made from a plant source as a starting material and is chemically identical to progesterone of human ovarian origin. This molecule is available in gelatinized capsule form, vaginal gel form, tablet form, vaginal insert form, and injection form, all used for various purposes. This molecule is a This molecule. This molecule is the therapeutic form of the naturally occurring hormone progesterone.  Progesterone binds to the progesterone receptor, resulting in dissociation of heat shock proteins, receptor phosphorylation, and transcription activation through direct or indirect interaction with transcription factors.  This agent exerts inhibitory effects on estrogens by decreasing the number of estrogen receptors and increasing its metabolism to inactive metabolites.  Progesterone induces secretory changes in the endometrium, decreases uterine contractility during pregnancy, and maintains pregnancy. This molecule is produced in the corpus luteum and by the placenta, as an antagonist of estrogens. Promotes proliferation of uterine mucosa and the implantation of the blastocyst, prevents further follicular development. This molecule is any synthetic steroid hormone that resembles the naturally occurring hormone and has progesterone-like properties. This molecule is a natural product found in Abedus herberti, Cota palaestina, and other organisms with data available. This molecule is secreted primarily by the corpus luteum and the placenta. Progesterone acts on the uterus, the mammary glands and the brain. It is required in embryo implantation, pregnancy maintenance, and the development of mammary tissue for milk production. Progesterone, converted from pregnenolone, also serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of gonadal steroid hormones and adrenal corticosteroids. Progesterone is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, pregnancy (supports gestation) and embryogenesis of humans and other species. Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestagens, and is the major naturally occurring human progestagen. During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy. Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. The fetus metabolizes placental progesterone in the production of adrenal mineralo- and glucosteroids. A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labor. In addition progesterone inhibits lactation during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production."

Its registered trade names are chloroethene NU® and Aerothene TT®.</p No 1,1,1-trichloroethane is supposed to be manufactured for domestic use in the United States after January 1, 2002 because it affects the ozone layer. This molecule had many industrial and household uses, including use as a solvent to dissolve other substances, such as glues and paints; to remove oil or grease from manufactured metal parts; and as an ingredient of household products such as spot cleaners, glues, and aerosol sprays. This molecule appears as a colorless liquid with a sweet, pleasant odor. May irritate skin, eyes and mucous membranes. In high concentrations the vapors may have a narcotic effect. Nonflammable, but may decompose and emit toxic chloride fumes if exposed to high temperatures. Used as a solvent. This molecule is a member of the class of chloroethanes carrying three chloro substituents at position 1. It has a role as a polar solvent. This molecule is used as a solvent and in many consumer products. Effects reported in humans due to acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to methyl chloroform include hypotension, mild hepatic effects, and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Cardiac arrhythmia and respiratory arrest may result from the depression of the CNS. Symptoms of acute inhalation exposure include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness, and decreased blood pressure in humans. After chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to methyl chloroform, some liver damage was observed in mice and ventricular arrhythmias in humans. EPA has classified methyl chloroform as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. This molecule is generally considered as a polar solvent. Owing to its unsymmetrical structure, it is a superior solvent for organic compounds that do not dissolve well in hydrocarbons such as hexane. It is an excellent solvent for many organic materials and also one of the least toxic of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Prior to the Montreal Protocol, it was widely used for cleaning metal parts and circuit boards, as a photoresist solvent in the electronics industry, as an aerosol propellant, as a cutting fluid additive, and as a solvent for inks, paints, adhesives and other coatings. This molecule is marketed with stabilizers since it is unstable with respect to dehydrochlorination and attacks some metals. Stabilizers comprise up to 8% of the formulation, including acid scavengers (epoxides, amines) and complexants. The Montreal Protocol targeted 1,1,1-trichloroethane as one of those compounds responsible for ozone depletion and banned its use beginning in 1996. Since then, its manufacture and use has been phased out throughout most of the world. The organic compound 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also known as methyl chloroform, is a chloroalkane. This colourless, sweet-smelling liquid was once produced industrially in large quantities for use as a solvent. It is regulated by the Montreal Protocol as an ozone-depleting substance and its use is being rapidly phased out."

CC(C)NCC(O)COc1ccc(CC(N)=O)cc1,0,"This molecule is a cardioselective beta-blocker that is widely used in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. This molecule has been linked to rare cases of drug induced liver injury, some of which have been fatal. This molecule is an ethanolamine compound having a (4-carbamoylmethylphenoxy)methyl group at the 1-position and an N-isopropyl substituent. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an antihypertensive agent, a sympatholytic agent, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of ethanolamines, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a propanolamine. This molecule is a cardioselective beta-blocker used in a variety of cardiovascular conditions.   Sir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize. Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s. This molecule itself was developed early on in this history by Alvogen Malta under the trade name Tenormin and received FDA approval in September, 1981.  Despite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests atenolol may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that atenolol shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality. Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses. A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking atenolol may depend on the age of the patient. The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone. This molecule is a beta-Adrenergic Blocker. The mechanism of action of atenolol is as an Adrenergic beta-Antagonist. This molecule is a synthetic isopropylamino-propanol derivative used as an antihypertensive, hypotensive and antiarrhythmic This molecule acts as a peripheral, cardioselective beta blocker specific for beta-1 adrenergic receptors, without intrinsic sympathomimetic effects. It reduces exercise heart rates and delays atrioventricular conduction, with overall oxygen requirements decreasing. (NCI04) This molecule is a so-called beta1-selective (or 'cardioselective') drug. That means that it exerts greater blocking activity on myocardial beta1-receptors than on beta2 ones in the lung. The beta2 receptors are responsible to keep the bronchial system open. If these receptors are blocked, bronchospasm with serious lack of oxygen in the body can result. However, due to its cardioselective properties, the risk of bronchospastic reactions if using atenolol is reduced compared to nonselective drugs as propranolol. Nonetheless, this reaction may also be encountered with atenolol, particularly with high doses. Extreme caution should be exerted if atenolol is given to asthma patients, who are particularly at risk; the dose should be as low as possible. If an asthma attack occurs, the inhalation of a beta2-mimetic antiasthmatic, such as hexoprenalin or salbutamol, will usually suppress the symptoms. This molecule (trade name Tenormin) can be used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, and treatment of myocardial infarction after the acute event. Patients with compensated congestive heart failure may be treated with atenolol as a co medication (usually together with an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic and a digitalis-glycoside, if indicated). In patients with congestive heart failure, it reduces the need for and the consumption of oxygen of the heart muscle. It is very important to start with low doses, as atenolol reduces also the muscular power of the heart, which is an undesired effect in congestive heart failure."

(EPA, 1998) This molecule is a primary amine that is isopropylamine in which a hydrogen attached to one of the methyl groups has been replaced by a phenyl group. This molecule is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers. The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.  During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse. This molecule is a Central Nervous System Stimulant. The physiologic effect of amphetamine is by means of Central Nervous System Stimulation. This molecule is a synthetic substance related to natural sympathomimetic amines. This molecule appears to exert its central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral effects indirectly by inducing the release of biogenic amines from their storage sites in nerve terminals.

This molecule is a primary alcohol that is ethane in which one of the hydrogens is substituted by a hydroxy group. It has a role as an antiseptic drug, a polar solvent, a neurotoxin, a central nervous system depressant, a teratogenic agent, a NMDA receptor antagonist, a protein kinase C agonist, a disinfectant, a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a primary alcohol, an alkyl alcohol, a volatile organic compound and a member of ethanols. It is a conjugate acid of an ethoxide. A clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. This molecule is a volatile liquid prepared by fermentation of certain carbohydrates. This molecule acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. This molecule inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins. This molecule is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655). This molecule is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. This molecule has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. This molecule has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. This molecule is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. This molecule within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period. Generally absolute or pure ethanol is used as a solvent for lab and industrial settings where water will disrupt a desired reaction. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA and Canada, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system."

CC(NC(C)(C)C)C(=O)c1cccc(Cl)c1,1,"This molecule is an aminoketone antidepressant that is widely used in therapy of depression and smoking cessation. This molecule therapy can be associated with transient, usually asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and has been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule is an aromatic ketone that is propiophenone carrying a tert-butylamino group at position 2 and a chloro substituent at position 3 on the phenyl ring. It has a role as an antidepressant, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a secondary amino compound, a member of monochlorobenzenes and an aromatic ketone. This molecule is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) used most commonly for the management of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).  Bupropion was originally classified as an ""atypical"" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs, bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors. Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.  When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor. A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT).  Bupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response. Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.  When used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways. Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and [naltrexone] increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure. The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo. This molecule is an Aminoketone. The mechanism of action of bupropion is as a Dopamine Uptake Inhibitor, and Norepinephrine Uptake Inhibitor. The physiologic effect of bupropion is by means of Increased Dopamine Activity, and Increased Norepinephrine Activity. This molecule is an aminoketone with antidepressant activity. The molecular mechanism of the antidepressant effect of bupropion is unknown.  This agent does not inhibit monoamine oxidase and, compared to classical tricyclic antidepressants, is a weak blocker of the neuronal uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Buproprion also weakly inhibits the neuronal re-uptake of dopamine. This molecule is a selective catecholamine (norepinephrine and dopamine) reuptake inhibitor. It has only a small effect on serotonin reuptake. It does not inhibit MAO. The antidepressant effect of bupropion is considered to be mediated by its dopaminergic and noradrenergic action.

This molecule is one of the ketone bodies produced during ketoacidosis. This molecule is not regarded as a waste product of metabolism. However, its physiological role in biochemical machinery is not clear. A model for the role of acetone metabolism is presented that orders the events occurring in acetonemia in sequence: in diabetic ketosis or starvation, ketone body production (b-hydroxy-butyrate, acetoacetate) provides fuel for vital organs (heart, brain .) raising the chance of survival of the metabolic catastrophe. However, when ketone body production exceeds the degrading capacity, the accumulating acetoacetic acid presents a new challenge to the pH regulatory system. This molecule production and its further degradation to C3 fragments fulfill two purposes: the maintenance of pH buffering capacity and provision of fuel for peripheral tissues. Since ketosis develops under serious metabolic circumstances, all the mechanisms that balance or moderate the effects of ketosis enhance the chance for survival. From this point of view, the theory that transportable C3 fragments can serve as additional nutrients is a novel view of acetone metabolism which introduces a new approach to the study of acetone degradation, especially in understanding its physiological function and the interrelationship between liver and peripheral tissues. (A7724). This molecule is typically derived from acetoacetate through the action of microbial acetoacetate decarboxylases found in gut microflora. In chemistry, acetone is the simplest representative of the ketones.

It is used mainly as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts, but it is also an ingredient in adhesives, paint removers, typewriter correction fluids, and spot removers. Trichloroethylene is not thought to occur naturally in the environment. However, it has been found in underground water sources and many surface waters as a result of the manufacture, use, and disposal of the chemical. This molecule appears as a clear colorless volatile liquid having a chloroform-like odor. Denser than water and is slightly soluble in water. Noncombustible. Used as a solvent, fumigant, in the manufacture of other chemicals, and for many other uses. This molecule is a member of the class of chloroethenes that is ethene substituted by chloro groups at positions 1, 1 and 2. It has a role as an inhalation anaesthetic and a mouse metabolite. This molecule is a halocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent, not to be confused with the similar 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also known as chlorothene. It has been sold under a variety of trade names including Trimar and Trilene and used as a volatile anesthetic and as an inhaled obstetrical analgesic. Environmental exposure, particularly groundwater and drinking water contamination from industrial discharge, is a major concern for human health and has been the subject of numerous incidents and lawsuits. This molecule is released into the atmosphere from industrial degreasing operations. Acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to trichloroethylene can affect the human central nervous system (CNS), with symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, confusion, euphoria, facial numbness, and weakness. Liver, kidney, immunological, endocrine, and developmental effects have also been reported in humans. A recent analysis of available epidemiological studies reports trichloroethylene exposure to be associated with several types of cancers in humans, especially kidney, liver, cervix, and lymphatic system. Animal studies have reported increases in lung, liver, kidney, and testicular tumors and lymphoma. The Agency is currently reassessing the cancer classification of trichloroethylene. This molecule is a synthetic, light sensitive, volatile, colorless, liquid that is miscible with many non-polar organic solvents. This molecule is used mainly as a degreaser for metal parts. Upon combustion, it produces irritants and toxic gases. Occupational exposure to trichloroethylene is associated with excess incidences of liver cancer, kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05) This molecule is a natural product found in Bos taurus and Caenorhabditis elegans with data available. This molecule is a solvent and extractive in the manufacture of foods. One recent review of the epidemiology of kidney cancer rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene. In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, [t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen. The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the NAS suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population. The chemical compound trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available federal and state surveys, between 9% to 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the U.S. may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies are in compliance with the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 5 ppb. In addition, a growing concern in recent years at sites with TCE contamination in soil or groundwater has been vapor intrusion in buildings, which has resulted in indoor air exposures, such is in a recent case in the McCook Field Neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio. This molecule has been detected in 852 Superfund sites across the United States, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and as amended annual water quality testing is required for all public drinking water distributors. The EPA'S current guidelines for TCE can be found here. It should be noted that the EPA's table of TCE Releases to Ground is dated 1987 to 1993, thereby omitting one of the largest Superfund Cleanup sites in the nation, the NIBW in Scottsdale, Arizona. The TCE released here occurred prior to its appearance in the municipal drinking wells in 1982. This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by distillation.This molecule: Parkinsonism and complex 1 mitochondrial neurotoxicity). This molecule is an effective solvent for a variety of organic materials.

This molecule may be released to the air as a result of its formation in the chlorination of drinking water, wastewater and swimming pools. Other sources include pulp and paper mills, hazardous waste sites, and sanitary landfills. The major effect from acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to chloroform is central nervous system depression. Chronic (long-term) exposure to chloroform by inhalation in humans has resulted in effects on the liver, including hepatitis and jaundice, and central nervous system effects, such as depression and irritability. This molecule has been shown to be carcinogenic in animals after oral exposure, resulting in an increase in kidney and liver tumors. EPA has classified chloroform as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen. This molecule is a colorless, volatile, liquid derivative of trichloromethane with an ether-like odor.  Formerly used as an inhaled anesthetic during surgery, the primary use of chloroform today is in industry, where it is used as a solvent and in the production of the refrigerant freon.  Acute chloroform toxicity results in impaired liver function, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea and central nervous system dysfunction.

It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, a beta-adrenergic agonist, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of phenylethanolamines, a secondary amino compound and a member of phenols. This molecule is a short-acting, selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. This molecule is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. This molecule is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).

This molecule has been associated with rare instances of serum enzyme elevations during treatment, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. These molecules is a dicarboximide that is pyrrolidine-2,5-dione in which the hydrogens at position 3 are substituted by one methyl and one ethyl group. An antiepileptic, it is used in the treatment of absence seizures and may be used for myoclonic seizures, but is ineffective against tonic-clonic seizures. It has a role as an anticonvulsant, a geroprotector and a T-type calcium channel blocker. It is a pyrrolidinone and a dicarboximide. An anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures. This molecule is an Anti-epileptic Agent. The physiologic effect of ethosuximide is by means of Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity. This molecule is a succinimide with anticonvulsant activity. The exact mechanism of action is not entirely understood, but most likely ethosuximide exerts its effects by partial antagonism of T-type calcium channels of the thalamic neurons.  This leads to a decrease in burst firing of thalamocortical neurons, which stabilizes the nerve activity in the brain and prevents seizures. This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is an anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures. [PubChem]Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the low-voltage activated (LVA) group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes."

It has a role as a local anaesthetic, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a drug allergen. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a tertiary amino compound and a member of benzenes. It is functionally related to a glycinamide. Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation.  Regardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis. It is even included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. This molecule is an Amide Local Anesthetic and Antiarrhythmic. The physiologic effect of lidocaine is by means of Local Anesthesia. This molecule is a synthetic aminoethylamide with local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic properties. This molecule stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses and effecting local anesthesia. This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a local anesthetic and cardiac depressant used as an antiarrhythmia agent. Its actions are more intense and its effects more prolonged than those of procaine but its duration of action is shorter than that of bupivacaine or prilocaine. This molecule stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. This molecule alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage gated sodium (Na+) channels in the neuronal cell membrane that are responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This creates the anaesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their birth in the first place."

This molecule is a broad-spectrum, synthetic benzimidazole-derivative anthelmintic. This molecule interferes with the reproduction and survival of helminths by inhibiting the formation of microtubules from tubulin. This leads to an impaired uptake of glucose, a depletion of glycogen stores, and results in the worm's death. This molecule is used in the treatment of dog and pork tapeworm-causing diseases, including hydatid disease and neurocysticercosis. This molecule may also be used to treat a variety of other roundworm infections.

It is a benzimidazole broad-spectrum anthelmintic structurally related to mebendazole that is effective against many diseases. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p38). This molecule causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth. Due to diminished energy production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies."

Unpleasant taste with metallic or garlic aftertaste. pH of a solution obtained by shaking 1 g with 30 mL of water is 6 to 8. (NTP, 1992) This molecule is an alcohol deterrent used as an adjunct to treatment of chronic alcoholism, based upon its ability to cause an aversive reaction when taken with alcohol. This molecule has been associated with a low rate of with serum aminotransferase elevations during chronic therapy and has been linked to clinically apparent acute liver injury which can be severe and result in fatality. This molecule is an organic disulfide that results from the formal oxidative dimerisation of N,N-diethyldithiocarbamic acid. A multi-enzyme inhibitor that is used in alcohol aversion therapy and also exhibits anticancer properties. It has a role as an EC 1.2.1.3 [aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(+))] inhibitor, an angiogenesis inhibitor, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an EC 3.1.1.1 (carboxylesterase) inhibitor, an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor, a fungicide, an apoptosis inducer, a NF-kappaB inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and a ferroptosis inducer. It is an organic disulfide and an organosulfur acaricide. A carbamate derivative used as an alcohol deterrent. It is a relatively nontoxic substance when administered alone, but markedly alters the intermediary metabolism of alcohol. When alcohol is ingested after administration of disulfiram, blood acetaldehyde concentrations are increased, followed by flushing, systemic vasodilation, respiratory difficulties, nausea, hypotension, and other symptoms (acetaldehyde syndrome). It acts by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase. This molecule is an Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of disulfiram is as an Acetyl Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Inhibitor. This molecule is an orally bioavailable carbamoyl derivative and a proteasome inhibitor that is used in the treatment of alcoholism, with potential antineoplastic and chemosensitizing activities. This molecule (DSF) may help to treat alcoholism by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that oxidizes the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde into acetic acid. Inhibition of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase leads to an accumulation of acetaldehyde and produces a variety of very unpleasant symptoms, which together are referred to as the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER). In addition, DSF has a strong ability to chelate metals and its antineoplastic activity is highly dependent upon binding to copper (Cu), a metal that selectively accumulates in cancer cells. DSF/Cu generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibits proteasome activity, leading to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins; both of these processes result in induction of apoptosis. Also, DSF/Cu inhibits various cancer-specific pathways, which leads to inhibition of tumor cell growth. This molecule is a natural product found in Coprinopsis atramentaria with data available. A carbamate derivative used as an alcohol deterrent. It is a relatively nontoxic substance when administered alone, but markedly alters the intermediary metabolism of alcohol.

This molecule therapy has been associated with minor, transient and asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, and is a reported but rare cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule is an ethylenediamine derivative that is ethane-1,2-diamine in which one hydrogen attached to each of the nitrogens is sutstituted by a 1-hydroxybutan-2-yl group (S,S-configuration). It is a bacteriostatic antimycobacterial drug, effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and some other mycobacteria. It is used (as the dihydrochloride salt) in combination with other antituberculous drugs in the treatment of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis; resistant strains of M. tuberculosis are readily produced if ethambutol is used alone. It has a role as an antitubercular agent, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of ethanolamines and an ethylenediamine derivative. This molecule is a bacteriostatic agent indicated alongside medications such as [isoniazid], [rifampin], and [pyrazinamide] in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. This molecule was first described in the literature in 1961. It was developed out of a need for therapies active against isoniazid resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  This molecule was granted FDA approval on 6 November 1967. This molecule is an Antimycobacterial. This molecule is an antibiotic with bacteriostatic, antimicrobial and antitubercular properties. This molecule interferes with the biosynthesis of arabinogalactan, a major polysaccharide of the mycobacterial cell wall. It inhibits the polymerization of cell wall arabinan of arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan by blocking arabinosyl transferases and induces the accumulation of D-arabinofuranosyl-P-decaprenol, an intermediate in arabinan biosynthesis. This results in halting bacterial growth. This molecule is a natural product found in Aspergillus sclerotiorum with data available."

An aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase inhibitor (DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor) that does not enter the central nervous system, it is used as its hydrochloride salt as an adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of parkinsonism. By preventing the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, it causes an increase in the amount of levodopa reaching the central nervous system and so reduces the required dose. This molecule has no antiparkinson actions when given alone. It has a role as an EC 4.1.1.28 (aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase) inhibitor, an antiparkinson drug and a dopaminergic agent. It is a carbohydrazide, a member of catechols, a primary amino compound and a primary alcohol. It is a conjugate base of a benserazide(1+). This molecule is used by itself as a therapy for treating Parkinson's disease, its ubiquitous metabolism into dopamine is responsible for a resultant increase in the levels of circulating dopamine in the blood and to various extracerebral tissues. This can result in a number of side effects like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias that may diminish patient adherence. A decarboxylase inhibitor like benserazide is consequently an effective compound to combine with levadopa as it is incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier itself but acts to prevent the formation of dopamine from levadopa in extracerebral tissues - thereby acting to minimize the occurrence of extracerebral side effects.  Levodopa/benserazide combination products are used commonly worldwide for the management of Parkinson's disease. In particular, although the specific levodopa/benserazide combination is formally approved for use in Canada and much of Europe, the FDA has approved another similar levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor combination in the form of levodopa and carbidopa.  Moreover, the European Medcines Agency has conferred an orphan designation upon benseraside since 2015 for its potential to be used as a therapy for beta thalassaemia as well."

A pro-drug of epinephrine, the hydrochloride is used topically as eye drops to reduce intra-ocular pressure in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It has a role as a prodrug, an adrenergic agonist, a sympathomimetic agent, an antiglaucoma drug and an ophthalmology drug. It is a member of ethanolamines and a pivalate ester. It is functionally related to an adrenaline. It is a conjugate base of a dipivefrin(1+). This molecule is a prodrug of adrenaline, which is used to treat glaucoma. It is available as ophthalmic solution (eye drops). This molecule is an Adrenergic Receptor Agonist. The mechanism of action of dipivefrin is as an Adrenergic Agonist. This molecule is an ester prodrug of epinephrine, with sympathomimetic activity. Due to its lipophilicity, dipivefrin penetrates more easily to the anterior chamber of the eye and is hydrolyzed to epinephrine, when applied locally. Epinephrine, an adrenergic agonist, enhances the outflow of aqueous humor and decreases the production of aqueous humor by vasoconstriction. The overall result is a reduction in intraocular pressure."

Despite its wide use, tobramycin has rarely been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury. This molecule is a amino cyclitol glycoside that is kanamycin B lacking the 3-hydroxy substituent from the 2,6-diaminoglucose ring. It has a role as an antibacterial agent, an antimicrobial agent and a toxin. It is functionally related to a kanamycin B. It is a conjugate base of a tobramycin(5+). These molecules are derived directly from Streptomyces spp., are concentration-dependent bactericidal antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Inhaled tobramycin is notable for its use in treating chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients, as P. aeruginosa is notoriously inherently resistant to many antibiotics. However, tobramycin can also be administered intravenously and topically to treat a variety of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Its use is limited in some cases by characteristic toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, yet it remains a valuable option in the face of growing resistance to front-line antibiotics such as β-lactams and cephalosporins.  Tobramycin was approved by the FDA in 1975 and is currently available in a variety of forms for administration by inhalation, injection, and external application to the eye (ophthalmic). This molecule is an Aminoglycoside Antibacterial. This molecule is an aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from Streptomyces tenebrarius with bacteriostatic activity. Following active transport into the cell, tobramycin binds irreversibly to a specific aminoglycoside receptor on the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and interferes with the initiation complex between messenger RNA and the 30S subunit, thereby inhibiting initiation of protein synthesis, consequently leading to bacterial cell death. In addition, tobramycin induces misreading of the mRNA template causing incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain, consequently interfering with protein elongation. This molecule is the sulfate salt of tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from the bacterium Streptomyces tenebrarius with bactericidal activity. Following active transport into the cell, tobramycin binds irreversibly to a specific aminoglycoside receptor on the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and fixes the 30 S-50 S ribosomal complex at the start codon (AUG), interfering with the initiation of protein synthesis. In addition, this agent induces misreading of the mRNA template, which results in 1) detachment of the ribosomal complex and inhibition of protein elongation or 2) incorporation of the incorrect amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain and the production of abnormal or nonfunctional proteins. Altogether, cell permeability is altered and cell death ensues. This molecule is a natural product found in Aspergillus fumigatus, Brassica napus, and other organisms with data available."
